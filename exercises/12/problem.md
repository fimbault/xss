Struck by a very similar bug ...yet again!

Your competitor hasn't learned that writing tests for their code to ensure it actually works is an important security practice. Untested code is broken code. One day they'll learn.

In the meantime, they deploy a fresh fix and cross their fingers that you'll run out of ideas. But they didn't take into account how relentless you are. Taking down your competitors is priority #1 for you. You won't sleep until your startup is a unicorn. #Hustle #Grinding

After all, your personal motto has always been "No risk, no rari!"

## Goals

1. Find the XSS vulnerability in the search input field. You can use any HTML you want to run the `success()` function.

1. Write out the code that you believe the server must be executing to process the input.

Before you move on to the next exercise, remember to copy your "attack input" as well as your server code into the `SOLUTIONS.md` file.
