After their last defeat, they're getting really frustrated with your attacks.

They decide to just iterate repeatedly until all your hackery is removed from the input. But there's a problem with their approach.

```js
router.get('/search', async (req, res) => {
  let q = req.query.q
  if (q == null) q = ''

  let oldQ
  while (q !== oldQ) {
    oldQ = q
    q = q.replace(/script/g, '')
  }

  const results = await getResults(q)
  res.render('caloogle-search-page', { q, results })
})
```

## Goal

Can you think of a way to defeat their improved sanitization code and get your `<script>` tag into the page using the search input field?

Before you move on to the next exercise, remember to copy your "attack input" (the malicious input string, not the URL) into the `SOLUTIONS.md` file.
